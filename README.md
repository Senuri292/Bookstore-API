# Bookstore-API

Bookstore API – Java Project
The Bookstore API is a backend application developed in Java that manages the core functionalities of an online bookstore. It is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure modular, maintainable, and scalable code. The API handles various entities including:

Books – storing details such as title, price, ISBN, and stock.

Authors – linking author data to books.

Customers – managing user accounts and customer details.

Carts – allowing customers to add/remove books before purchasing.

Orders – placing and processing orders from customer carts.


<br>
<b>Key Features:</b><br>

CRUD operations for each entity using RESTful API endpoints.

Encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction to manage relationships between classes (e.g., Book → Author, Customer → Cart).

Validations to prevent incorrect data entries.

Organized into layers (e.g., controller, service, model) for better separation of concerns.


<br>
<b>Testing:</b><br>

Postman is used to test each endpoint by sending HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

JSON is used for request and response formatting.
